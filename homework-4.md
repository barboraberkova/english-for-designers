# 📝 Homework 4: Presentation: What do I do?

## What I worked on

I created a short presentation featuring some of my work. 
I was away from my computer for a long time and the only tool I had on me was my old iPad. So I created the presentation in Keynote on my iPad.
This is me the morning of the presentation, finishing just some minor things
