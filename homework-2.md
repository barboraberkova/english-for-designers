# 📝 Homework 2: Alt text & Type Specimen

## What I worked on

### Part 1: Alt Text

Using your alt text writing experience from in-class:

Write two alt text descriptions without AI assistance. Aim for variety: emotional, technical, concise, and document your iteration process.
Generate two alt text descriptions using AI assistance (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), then edit and revise them based on the best practices. Document what you changed and why.
Review all four, then synthesize: write one final alt text description that combines the best of what you learned from writing with and without AI assistance.
Document: All five versions with character counts and your iterations (and notes).

### Part 2: Type Specimen

Create a typographic composition featuring your bespoke drop cap in a meaningful text context.

Write First

Write an original short text (125–250 words) that features your letter and reflects your relationship to craft, design, typography, the making process, or a recent topic that interests you. Write it yourself — no AI, no copying. Use clear, direct language that people would actually want to read.

Note: Quality over quantity. 125 meaningful words beat 250 of filler text.

Design Second

Create a typographic composition that brings together your drop cap and your written text.
