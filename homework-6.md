# 📝 Homework 6: Business Card & Handshake

## What I worked on

# Business Card

In class, we were tasked with designing personal business cards. Since we already have existing cards for our agency, it was a unique challenge to develop a completely new concept. I began the process by creating digital sketches in Figma before transferring the final card design to paper.

## Result

## First version

Hi, I'm Bara, the Head of Design at Keyspace Media. 
I believe that design is the solution for our world to function—it's everything around us, shaping us and making our world a better place. I hold the view that small details truly matter, even the ones no one can see, because they define the quality of everything we create.
