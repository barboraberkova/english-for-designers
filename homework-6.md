# 📝 Homework 6: Business Card

## What I worked on

In class, we were tasked with designing personal business cards. Since we already have existing cards for our agency, it was a unique challenge to develop a completely new concept. I began the process by creating digital sketches in Figma before transferring the final card design to paper.
