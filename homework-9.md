# What I said during my presentation?

Hello! My name is Bara.

I truly believe that design is the solution that makes our world function. You might be asking why, so let’s take a look at this.

Why have this, when we can have this? What you’re seeing here is what the Apple website would look like without design. But with intentional, great design, you create something functional. You make the world work better. That is my philosophy: every detail matters—even the little ones, like a single missing dot.

Because of this mindset, I serve as the Head of Design at Keyspace, our creative agency. We specialize in graphic design, web design, marketing and media, and photography and video.

So, what is my day-to-day job? Well, I make sure that this (a mess) turns into this (a masterpiece). Or, when someone uses a bold font, I tell them to use medium instead—because sometimes, that's exactly what it takes to make it look right.

I’ve selected a few projects to show you what I’ve been working on:

Roomloop: A visual identity for a student housing platform. We designed their logo, printed materials, and merchandise.

Monrix: We created their logo and are still collaborating closely, currently developing their printed materials and a brand-new website.

Havlík Law Agency: We delivered a fresh logo, business cards, and various brand assets.

Do you like what we do? Let’s work together! Take a look at our website and hit me up.
