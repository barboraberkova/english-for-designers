# Hello!
Hi, I'm Bara, the Head of Design at Keyspace Media. 
I believe that design is the solution for our world to function—it's everything around us, shaping us and making our world a better place. I hold the view that small details truly matter, even the ones no one can see, because they define the quality of everything we create.
