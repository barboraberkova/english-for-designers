# 📝 Homework 3: Metadata and Preview Image Variations

## What I worked on

Create and evaluate three versions of metadata and preview images for your type specimen, focusing on meaningfulness, accessibility, and visual clarity.

Write three metadata variations, each concise, descriptive, and accessible:
Title: up to 60 characters
Use title case for formal tone or sentence case for conversational tone
Description: up to 150 characters
Alt Text (for preview image): up to 100–125 characters
Test your writing: Use Hemingway Editor to check readability and aim for grade 9 or below
Create three preview image variations, each with a different crop or edit:
Suggested size: 1200 × 628 px (landscape, ratio 1.91:1)
Design for resilience and adaptability:
Strong focal point (works at multiple scales)
High color contrast (test with Coblis Color Blindness Simulator)
Legible when scaled down (platforms vary in how they crop and resize)
Note: The 1200 × 628 px size is standard for social media previews (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) and banners.
