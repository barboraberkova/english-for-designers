Voice, Tone, and Style

Websites, apps, and social have become an integral part of our daily lives. They’re not just functional tools, they’re carefully crafted brand experiences that reflect specific values, personalities, and identities. Every word, notification, and interaction is designed to reinforce who that brand is and what it stands for. So, in this workshop, we’re going to explore how brands communicate consistently across multiple channels and platforms, and use those insights to develop your own voice, tone, and style.

To start, I want you to think about one (or two) of your favorite apps or digital brands. It could be a game, a productivity tool, a social media platform, or anything else.

As you reflect on your chosen brand, consider these questions:

Brand personality and tone: Is the brand playful and witty, serious and straightforward, warm and encouraging, or something else entirely? If this brand were a person, how would you describe their character?
Strategic language choices: What specific words, phrases, or messaging patterns does the brand consistently use? How do these choices reflect their core values and target audience?
Emotional resonance: What overall feeling does the brand’s communication create? Is it welcoming and friendly, empowering and motivational, sleek and professional, or reserved and trustworthy?
