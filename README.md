# Hello! 🙋‍♀️
I’m Barbora Berková, Head of Design at Keyspace Media.

I believe that design is the solution for our world to function—it's everything around us, shaping us and making our world a better place. I hold the view that small details truly matter, even the ones no one can see, because they define the quality of everything we create.

I'm a student, currently finishing my last year at VŠKK, a head of design and KeySpace, a creative person

## 📚 My School Work

This section provides an overview and links to my academic projects and assignments.

I am studying Graphic and Media Design at VŠKK in Prague. It's given me a lot of experience, from design to marketing and much more. 
This year, we (finally) have an English class, where we do some very interesting stuff. I have to say that it has helped me a lot and I see some things differently now, thanks to Justin and our class. 
I believe that you mind find some of the things we did in class interesting, so go and explore it yourself!
